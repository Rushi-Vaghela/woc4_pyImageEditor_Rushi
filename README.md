# woc4_pyImageEditor_Rushi

This is the basic or intial ImageEditor python project file.

In this you can add image, crop it, make some flip, and rotate also and the black and white filter.
rotate  = transpose in this 
the invert filter dosen't do anything yet I am working on it,
in the crop you have to first select the porsion and then click the enter button to see croped image.
